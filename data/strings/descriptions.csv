uaf_nakiha,SHIP,"The Nakiha class is a leader class of frigate commissioned by the Auroran Federation Navy. The class is also highly regarded to be a successful design as it quickly become the backbone of the navy for its above average overall performance and its atmospheric flight capability. 

The fourth generation Nakiha first came out during the desperate defensive war over Aurora against the onslaught of combined sector invasion forces. Its modular design and ability to fly in planetary conditions allowed it to be a vital contribution to the homeworld defense as it can be produced en masse from ground production facilities, then launch into space via its own power or mass drive. This nimble and versatile warship should never be underestimated by its foe, or suffer the consequences as it may hold a couple of hidden surprises against any oblivious enemies.",,,

This ship was given up-to-date military-grade upgrades and a unique camouflage pattern belonging to the Auroran Royal Navy's November Fleet which is led personally by the Queen of Yuria herself. Additional armor plating and durable protective coating were installed to enhance the survivability of this ship; albeit at the cost of slightly lowered maneuverability and speed due to additional weight.

,,,,,
uaf_novayu,SHIP,"The Novayu was designed alongside the Nakiha class Frigate Leader as part of the advanced frigate procurement program. Unlike the other one, it sacrificed ballistic firepower in exchange for the versatility of missile weaponry. its medium-sized twin missile compartment could potentially deliver a bigger punch depending on the loadout of the ship itself. Its commonly mistaken as the Nakiha as it shared too many similarities in terms of performance and visual aesthetics.",,,

uaf_reisen,SHIP,"The Reisen class Pocket Battleship is one of the standard issue capital warship commissioned by the Auroran Federation Navy. It is developed to emphasize on overwhelming ballistic firepower which makes it suitable in a naval combat or siege battles. It is also the first large capital class to be ever constructed with ""guns blazing-or-nothing"" offensive doctrine in mind.

It will typically outrange and outgun any foes long before they come within range to engage the Reisen thanks to its advanced rangefinder systems. It is also designed with rather uncommon weapon layout where the main weapons are positioned alongside each other but with the rear at slightly higher elevation which allowed all guns to converge on the same target, so long as the target stays at optimal angle of engagement. This frontline battleship will require its escorts to protect her flanks, its poor mobility doesn't allow her to disengage easily from combat as it is equipped with super-heavy armor plating to protect itself against incoming fire.",,,

uaf_rillaru,SHIP,"The standard-issue battlecruiser that would become the most reliable capital ship to have ever served the Auroran Federation Navy. Famously known for its versatility in terms of firepower and agility, along with its sleek-ish design aesthetics which makes it a common favorite among crewmates and commanding officers alike.

If firepower and survivability aren't the issues, half of the fleet admirals and captains would typically favor the Rillaru as their flagship, regardless of the fleet composition or formation. Not only is it nimble enough to maneuver around the enemy formation and strike from favorable angle of attack. It's also large and heavily armed enough to pose a threat to or ward off the enemy due to its balanced weapon layout with the possibility of engaging in successful duels with proper battleships given the right armaments and a skillfull captain.",,,

A rare variant of the Rillaru, this post-production battlecruiser was upgraded with extended side-mounted weapon platforms next to its flight decks. It is also installed with a reverse-engineered phase skimmer system which would give her unparalleled agility unlike its stock version.

uaf_purcellyra,SHIP,"A newcomer among the already established capital formation of the Auroran Federation Navy. this unproven missile battlecruiser could potentially yield devastating amount of firepower to anyone facing against her, should all of her missiles are left untouched and reach their targets.

The Purcellyra was built with ""guns blazing-or-nothing"" doctrine in mind with a twist of missile weaponry instead of ballistics. It was designed specifically to be a missile platform that carries strategic weapon of mass destruction on the table. If conventional or diplomatic means are no longer viable, bringforth the Purcellyra and her righteous instruments - she will bring the music of death straight to the enemy.",,,
uaf_m_fusoreina,SHIP,"After witnessing the pure might of the Onslaught and Paragon class Battleships, it become clear that the Auroran Navy wouldn't stand a chance if they don't have a suitable frontline capital ship that can fight them head-on or at least, hold the line long enough until reinforcement are able to support them.

The Fusoreina was designed as the stopgap solution to such capital problem. She is equipped with super-heavy armor plating and forward facing weaponry along with reverse-engineered 'fortress'-like shield technology, ripped from the carcass of a former Tri-Tachyon battleship. These upgrades will ensure longevity and survivability to the absolute limit but it was proven to be too costly of a niche investment for the Navy to fully commission into the capital formation.

This rare ship is part of the 'Prototypes' that are declined into service of the Auroran Federation Navy, but still chosen to be produced in limited numbers. It is painted with the navy dazzle camouflage patterns with gold stripes along the forward bow to signify its prototype status.",,,
uaf_isenoria_prototype,SHIP,"Although the Navy generally favored aircraft carriers over classic warships, they wouldn't deny the significance of having ships that can stand their ground and exchange fire without being taken out of the fight quickly.. but what if you can combine both roles into one? Isenoria is the result of such curiosity. 

The plan was to ensure that a fleet would benefit from having a battleship and aircraft carrier from a single capital ship. A large deck was installed on the rear part of the ship with the superstructure and flux vent funnel intergrated in the middle, while the opposite bit will have all sizes of ballistic weaponry facing forward. Such design would be fitting of the term, 'glass cannon' as this ship is the jack of all trades, the master of none.

This rare ship is part of the 'Prototypes' that are declined into service of the Auroran Federation Navy, but still chosen to be produced in limited numbers. It is painted with the navy dazzle camouflage patterns with gold stripes along the forward bow to signify its prototype status.",,,
uaf_sentry,SHIP,"Before the secretive Trio Naval Plan come to fruition, the Navy needed a siege ship that can stay well out of enemy range while bombarding them from safe distance. The existing capital ships are unable to meet such demand as both sides are already within range of each other by the time they're armed and ready.

The Sentry class Artillery Cruiser isn't really a ship in itself, it is merely a flying glass cannon warship with engines and weapons strapped around it. Its dual-barreled railguns are customized to be able to fire from extreme range while still retaining its penetrative capabilities. Once the crew compartments and other necessities are installed, the remaining space are used to add additional weapons to serve as complementary back-up. This left no room for further improvements as the existing shield emitter can only protect so much when most of the flux capacitors are dedicated for the main guns.

uaf_eyeseau,SHIP,"The Eyeseau class is an auxillary command ship that serves as a floating platform for overall command and support purposes such as Electronic Warfare, Countermeasures and Command Control.
 
Its powerful sensors will not only detect anything man-made within its extreme range, but also emit disruptive frequencies that will disable any unprotected spacecraft or warships so long as the signal continues to be transmitted. The ship is also capable of conducting planetary survey and perform exploration missions as the necessary equipment come in by default.
Such advanced technologies may grant amazing capabilities. However, it requires frequent maintenance cycles and reliable logistical support to keep them functional. Rest assured, the cost might be worth it however as the name goes - She can see you. No matter where you are.

uaf_slvv_core,SHIP,"The Solvernia V is the pinnacle of Auroran space engineering. It was developed as part of the secretive naval super capital project, a plan that will carry the exploration force far beyond into the Sector and away from home. The ship was designed to be a flagship for the navy that could possibly overwhelm and outlive any rivals. Although it is by all means a combat ship, its secondary purpose is to also accompany an exploration fleet deep into the Sector, expect the unexpected they say. Her frontal firepower isn’t just for show either, she will bite anyone who dares to threaten.

She is the first of the trio super capitals to be drafted and constructed, just in time to join the first and bold few who dared to blindly sail into the unknown. 

The Solvernia possessed an unholy combination of immense firepower and impenetrable defenses that could only be powered by the most powerful Melody nuclear fusion reactor available to the Auroran. The signature dazzle camouflage pattern could not only confuse enemies but also possibly intimidate anyone into fearing her. She needn’t to hide, she wants to be seen by all. Only the bravest navy admiral and mightiest armada would dare to challenge her as the dreadnought even alone without escorts are able to defend herself, should the need ever arise.

“The Solvernia is our embodiment of might and prosperity. Welcoming with open arms to those who wish to be peaceful with us but also stand fast and fight if anyone dares to challenge us. Even a pen and sword can be mutually beneficial if used right together. “ Aeria Charlotte Yuki, Permaisuri of the United Auroran Federation.",,,
uaf_novaeria,SHIP,"The Novaeria on the other hand is the opposite of Solvernia. If one is specialized in firepower and intimidation, the other is more an overall strategic command and control. The crown jewel and mastermind of the trio. Currently commissioned as a flagship type for the autonomous semi-faction of the United Aurora Federation.

She is the bigger one of the two twin sisters. Her lack of direct firepower is compensated with rather impressive numbers of fighter wings for maximum power projection, all thanks to her massive twin forward hulls as they’re capable of housing even a couple smaller destroyers. She is also equipped with the most advanced communications and surveillance technologies to be use for both military and space exploration purposes.

Needless to say, the Novaeria are both militarily and diplomatically strategic asset. A perfect tool to spread influence across any region as her mighty presence can be felt where ever she goes; she is after all a mobile base of operations that carries along a vast spherical form of autonomous territory. Anyone or anything will be dealt with accordingly, should they somehow decided to do something she doesn’t like.

This opened up large amount of room for further modifications and top-of-the-line upgrades that normally wouldn't be possible on a normal ship. A reverse-engineered recall teleport system was also installed into the ship which allowed it to summon its deployed fighter wings back to instantly re-arm and re-fit without delay.

Its vast number of fighter wings and battleship-like armaments will ensure that no one would dare to approach her without getting punished for it.

The carrier was exclusively commissioned and used by the Royal November Fleet as they require a capital class carrier ship with enough firepower and armor to stay at the frontline for a prolonged time. Its streamlined air operations were made easier thanks to its runway which runs along its spine. Spacecrafts may take off from the front while the returning ones would enter from the side hangar bays. Despite its own capability to be independent from needing any escorts, its rarely seen without one as the Zepporia II would require tremendous amount of resources and effort to even construct a single one of them.
