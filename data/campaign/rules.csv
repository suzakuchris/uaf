An Earth-like world where these Aurorian people came from. The Aurorians have made themselves clear, they're here to stay and make themselves at home as tall, sleek skyscrapers were built in designated residential zones surrounded by pristine yet relatively untouched natural earthly landscape. It also gives you an impression that they're not here to invade and conquer due to the lack of obvious military infrastructure and instead, open for trading and other peaceful intentions. Promoters and other sorts of entrepeneurs came to greet you as they guide you to the nearby trade zones not far from the spaceport."" textGrayColor",,,

There are all sorts of spaceships flying by and military structures can be seen around you as they seems to be surrounding a single, massive naval staging base within a large crater. You think you noticed an oddly large ship parked far beyond the dark side of the moon but you might be fooled by your own eyes. Nevertheless, you have arrived at the designated trading post that provides amenities and comfort for people deciding to stay for a night or two; albeit with limited or no access to the surrounding region."" textGrayColor",,,

People of all sorts, regardless of their origins are allowed to stay here and try to make a living so long as nobody cause any problems for anyone. Half of the station's trading zone are dedicated for selling Aurorian goods, even those that came from beyond the 'Mirror Universe' as they say while the other are your usual good ol' Starsector material and goodies. There are even those exquisite black market stuff available if you look around hard enough."" textGrayColor",,,

However, piracy and other sort of criminal oddities have infested this world and make themselves known due to far distance and remote nature. Stolen ships are being stripped apart and cannibalized as black market thrives in a place such as this."" textGraycolor",,,
